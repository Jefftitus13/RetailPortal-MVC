# Retail Portal MVC Project Overview
This repository contains an MVC-based retail portal designed for an insurance application system. The project leverages ADO.NET for database interactions, utilizing stored procedures to efficiently manage data operations. Within this portal, users can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing them to manage insurance policies, sponsor details, member information, and related data. The application is structured to provide a seamless user experience, from applying for insurance policies to managing all aspects of the policy lifecycle. By combining the power of ADO.NET with stored procedures, this project ensures robust, efficient, and secure data handling, making it a solid foundation for retail and insurance-related applications.
